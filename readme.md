# SPH_Hashing
## Description

This project enhances the SPH simulation program developed in the [previous project](https://github.com/AhmedElbossily/SPH_thermal_CPU) by speeding it up 24x using spacial hashing.

## Building the project

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the `SPH_thermal_CPU` directory:
```
cd SPH_thermal_CPU
```

3. Create a `build` directory:
```
mkdir build
```

4. Change to the `build` directory:
```
cd build
```

5. Build the project:
```
cmake ..
```

6. Compile the project:
```
make
```

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the following command:

```
./SPH_Hashing
```

## Expected outputs 

- You can monitor the percentage of completion on the terminal.
- The output files will be saved in the `results` folder inside the project directory.
